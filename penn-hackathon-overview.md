## National Instruments Speakers:
* David Whatley – Embedded Systems Group Manager and hiring manager
* Scot Salmon – Embedded Systems Principal Design Engineer and expert in C++ design and implementation for embedded systems
* Ken Sharp – Embedded Systems Design Senior Engineer and expert in maker/hackathon type projects
* Erik Hons – Embedded Systems Principal Design Engineer and expert in embedded systems architectures

## Overview of the 12-hour OVERNIGHT event: 
* "Cracking the Interview Code" (i.e., resume writing and interview skills) 
* "C++ coding bootcamp with deep technical sessions on embedded RTOS’s and Linux Real Time" 
* LabVIEW Challenge
* A 12-hour Embedded Systems Hackathon (16 teams) –NI engineers will be available during the hackathon for questions and consultation
* Job Interviews 

## Syllabus for C++ BootCamp
* Scot: How we chose Linux RT
* Ken: Gratian’s: Embedded Linux debugging tools. Cyclic test and ftrace. Hands-on?
* Ken: Sev’s: NIWeek Advanced NI Linux RT. Hands-on?
* Scot/Erik?: C++ in Embedded Systems, plus memory management
* Erik? Embedded performance considerations
* Scot: NITech: one of the live hacking demos?

## Students’ Preparations

### Apply to interview
Students are encouraged to apply to the UPenn NI job posting before the hackathon. NI will not be able to interview without the application being completed online.
* Embedded Systems Software Engineer - Fulltime
* Embedded Systems Software Engineer - Intern

### Get ready for hacking
Install the following software on their laptop (Windows, Mac, or Linux):
* At least one of the following ESP8266 toolchains
  * RECOMMENDED: Arduino IDE (Windows, Mac, Linux)
    * Arduino IDE 1.6.5 or later
    * Arduino ESP8266 Addon
  * GCC with Linux (Linux)
    * How to set up manually the GCC toolchain
  * VirtualBox VM (Windows, Mac, Linux)
    * Build Environment Guide
* The latest ESP8266 SDK (universal, non-OS)
  * Lots of good documentation in ./document/EN/*
  * AT command set firmware in ./bin/at/*
  * Other SDK options include a Mesh SDK and an RTOS SDK.
* The official Espressif Flash Download Tool
  * Use this to download the AT command set firmware or any other firmware built with Gcc toolchain.
  * (Arduino IDE will automatically download the firmware built in the IDE.)
* Review the ESP8266 Tutorial for Beginners.
